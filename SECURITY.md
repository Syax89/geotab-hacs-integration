## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this integration seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email the maintainer:** Send a detailed report to [simone.rondina@gmail.com](mailto:simone.rondina@gmail.com).
2. **Provide details:** Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact.
3. **Wait for a response:** We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix as quickly as possible.

## Security Practices in this Project
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** We never store passwords or tokens in the code.
- **Privacy First:** Sensitive data (like usernames) are hidden from public views in Home Assistant.
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in checks prevent excessive API calls that could lead to account bans.
- **Regular Audits:** We perform security scans to ensure the project remains robust.
